Bloom makes a distinction between emotional empathy and cognitive empathy. 
What’s the difference?
Bloom argues that, overall, emotional empathy is morally negative. Does Bloom think cognitive empathy is also morally negative, or does he view it differently? Explain. 
ChatGPT said:
Вот тебе краткий, чёткий и понятный ответ на оба вопроса — идеально для обсуждения или для письменного задания.

1. В чём разница между emotional empathy и cognitive empathy у Bloоm?

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7118vVBfDxL._UF1000%2C1000_QL80_.jpg
Emotional empathy (аффективная эмпатия) — это переживание чужих эмоций как своих собственных.
Ты чувствуешь то же, что и другой человек: его боль, страх, страдание. Это “feeling with”.

Cognitive empathy — это понимание чужих эмоций, мыслей, мотивов, без обязательного переживания.
Это способность представить себе: “Что он сейчас чувствует?” — но не обязательно чувствовать то же самое. Это “understanding”.

2. Считает ли Bloom emotional empathy морально вредной? А как он относится к cognitive empathy?
Bloom о emotional empathy
Bloom критикует эмоциональную эмпатию и считает её морально отрицательной по нескольким причинам:

она узко сфокусирована на одном человеке → ведёт к неравной, несправедливой морали;

она усиливает предвзятость и фаворитизм (“мне жаль тех, кто похож на меня”);

она приводит к иррациональным решениям и усталости (empathic distress);

она мотивирует **импульсив

in english pls
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clear, concise explanation in English—perfect for a class discussion or short written response.

1. What is the difference between emotional empathy and cognitive empathy according to Bloom?
Emotional empathy (also called affective empathy)
→ Feeling what another person feels.
You share their pain, fear, sadness, or joy as if it were your own. It’s “feeling with” someone.

Cognitive empathy
→ Understanding what another person feels or thinks without necessarily sharing the emotion.
It’s the ability to take someone else’s perspective. It’s “understanding” rather than “feeling.”

2. Bloom argues that emotional empathy is morally negative. Does he think cognitive empathy is also morally negative?
Bloom on emotional empathy
Bloom believes emotional empathy is often morally harmful because:

It is biased — we empathize more with people who look like us or are close to us.

It leads to partial and unfair moral decisions, focusing on specific individuals rather than everyone affected.

It can cause emotional burnout and distress.

It encourages impulsive, short-sighted actions rather than thoughtful responses.

So yes — Bloom argues emotional empathy is overall morally negative.

Bloom on cognitive empathy
Bloom views cognitive empathy very differently.

He does not think cognitive empathy is morally negative.
Instead, he sees it as a morally neutral tool — something that can be used for good or for bad.

Used well, cognitive empathy helps us understand others' needs, communicate effectively, and make fair, rational moral decisions.

Used badly, it can also help people manipulate or exploit others (e.g., a con artist or torturer understanding victims’ emotions).

But overall, Bloom argues that cognitive empathy is valuable, especially when paired with rational compassion (caring for others without absorbing their emotions).

Short summary
Emotional empathy = feeling others’ emotions → Bloom thinks this is morally harmful.

Cognitive empathy = understanding others’ emotions → Bloom thinks this is morally neutral or positive, depending on how it’s used.

Let me know if you want this turned into a 2–3 sentence answer or a paragraph for a discussion post.

You said:
maybe you can answer shorter a bit?
ChatGPT said:
Sure — here’s a shorter, clean version:

Emotional empathy means feeling what another person feels.
Cognitive empathy means understanding what another person feels without sharing the emotion.

Bloom argues that emotional empathy is morally harmful because it is biased, exhausting, and leads to unfair or impulsive decisions.
He does not think the same about cognitive empathy — he sees it as a useful, morally neutral skill that can help us make better decisions when paired with compassion.

You said:
nah, with bullet points
ChatGPT said:
Sure — here’s the short bullet-point version:

Difference:

Emotional empathy: feeling another person’s emotions as your own.

Cognitive empathy: understanding what someone else feels without necessarily feeling it.

Bloom’s view:

Emotional empathy: morally negative — it’s biased, selective, and can lead to poor, impulsive decisions.

Cognitive empathy: not morally negative — it’s a neutral skill that can be used for good (better understanding, communication) or bad (manipulation), but Bloom generally sees it as useful when combined with rational compassion.

Got you — here’s a clean, natural LinkedIn-style post in English that highlights your experience, your fear of coding, and how you built your job-application tracker. You can copy-paste it as is:

LinkedIn Post Draft (English)
Over the past few weeks, I finally tackled something I had been avoiding for years.
I’ve always been afraid of programming and tried to stay as far away from it as possible — it felt intimidating and “not for me.”

But applying to dozens of jobs every week made me realize I needed a smarter system.
So I decided to build one myself.

I wrote a Python script that automatically logs every job I apply to into a spreadsheet — company, role, location, link, salary, status, and more. It helps me stay organized and track patterns in my search, and honestly, I’m proud that I pushed through the discomfort to make it work.

I’m sharing this because:

stepping outside your comfort zone really does pay off,

learning something new is never as scary as it feels,

and sometimes the best tools are the ones you build for your own needs.

If anyone wants the code or wants to try something similar, I’m happy to share and discuss!

If you want, I can also make:
🔥 a shorter version
🔥 a more technical version
🔥 a version with a GitHub link (I can help you upload the code)

Just tell me which style you prefer.

You said:
Make it sound less robotic, a bit more casual and suggest what's the best way of sharing the code? I have a github account to do so
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a more casual, natural version — still professional, but more “human.”
I also added a smooth line about sharing your code on GitHub.

LinkedIn Post (casual + professional)
I recently pushed myself to do something I’ve avoided for years: write code.

I’ve always been low-key terrified of programming and tried to stay far away from it — it just never felt like “my thing.” But sending out tons of job applications every week made me realize I needed a better system to stay organized.

So I finally sat down and built one.

I wrote a small Python script that automatically logs every job I apply to into a spreadsheet — company, role, location, link, salary, notes, everything. It’s nothing crazy, but it saves me time and feels good to have created something useful from scratch.

I’m sharing this because stepping out of my comfort zone ended up being way less scary than I expected — and kind of fun.

I’ll probably post the script on GitHub so anyone can use it or tweak it. If you're curious or want to build something similar, I’m happy to share the repo or chat about it!

If you want, I can also:

shorten it,

make it funnier,

or write the GitHub description/readme for your code.

the post looks too naked, what should I add to the post, so it will look better? I can add a screenshot
ChatGPT said:
Here’s exactly what will make your LinkedIn post look much stronger, more engaging, and more “complete” — without overwhelming people.

✅ What to Add to Make the Post Look Better
1. Add a screenshot of your Google Sheet (the tracker)
This is the BEST possible visual.
It instantly shows the impact of your code and makes your post stand out in the feed.

Use the screenshot you already took — the one with rows of company names, roles, salary, status colors, etc.

People LOVE seeing:

structure

color-coded statuses

“work in progress” tools

something real that you built

Your tracker literally is the proof of your idea → perfect LinkedIn content.

2. Add a link to your GitHub repo
Upload your Python script to GitHub and include the link at the bottom of your post.

Example to paste at the end:

GitHub repo (code here): github.com/fzybin/job-application-tracker

(This looks clean and professional.)

I can help you name the repo and write the README if you want.

3. Add 1–2 sentences of context above the screenshot
For example:

Here’s what the tracker looks like after running the script for a few days 👇
It helped me stay organized while applying to dozens of roles — so I figured it might help someone else too.

This sets up the screenshot so it doesn’t feel random.

4. Add a small call-to-action
Something simple like:

If this looks useful, let me know — I’m happy to share the code or improve it further.

Or:

Always open to suggestions from people who automate their job search!

This increases engagement.

🔥 Here is your improved post with these elements incorporated
You can replace your text with this updated version:

LinkedIn Post (final polished version)
I recently pushed myself to do something I’ve avoided for years: write code.

I’ve always been a little scared of programming and stayed far away from it — it never felt like “my thing.” But sending out tons of job applications every week made me realize I needed a better way to stay organized.

So I finally sat down and built one.

I wrote a small Python script that automatically logs every job I apply to into a spreadsheet — company, role, location, link, salary, notes, everything. It’s nothing crazy, but it saves me time and feels good to have created something useful from scratch.

Here’s what the tracker looks like after running it for a bit 👇
(add your screenshot here)

Stepping out of my comfort zone ended up being way less scary than I expected — and honestly, kind of fun.

I’ll be posting the script on GitHub so anyone can use it or tweak it.
If you're curious or want to build something similar, I’m happy to share the repo or chat about it!

GitHub repo: (insert link)

If you want, I can also:
👉 choose the BEST screenshot from your files,
👉 write the README for the GitHub repo,
👉 help name your project in a cool way,
👉 polish the post even further for recruiters.

You said:
. Add a link to your GitHub repo

how do I do that?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a simple step-by-step guide on how to add your code to GitHub and include the repo link in your LinkedIn post. I’ll make it super easy.

✅ STEP 1 — Create a new GitHub repository
Go to https://github.com/

Log into your account.

In the top-right, click the “+” icon → New repository.

Fill in:

Repository name: something like job-application-tracker

Description: “Python script that logs all my job applications into a Google Sheet.”

Visibility: Public (so people can view the code)

Click Create repository.

✅ STEP 2 — Upload your Python script
After you create the repo:

Click “Add file” → Upload files

Drag your .py script into the window.

Click Commit changes (bottom of the page).

Done. Your code is now live.

✅ STEP 3 — Copy your GitHub link
After uploading:

You’ll be on your repo’s homepage.

Copy the URL from your browser — it should look like:

https://github.com/<your_username>/job-application-tracker
Example (fake):

https://github.com/fzybin/job-application-tracker
This is the link you will paste into LinkedIn.

✅ STEP 4 — Add the link to your LinkedIn post
Scroll to the end of your post draft and add:

GitHub repo: https://github.com/<your_username>/job-application-tracker

LinkedIn will automatically turn it into a clickable link.

If you want, I can create:
🔥 a clean repo description (README.md)
🔥 instructions for others to run your script
🔥 a better repo name
🔥 a more “professional” project structure (e.g., /src, /requirements.txt)

Just tell me!

You said:
I also added read me
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — adding a README makes your repo look 10× more professional.
Now to finish strong, here’s what you should do next and how to make sure your LinkedIn post + GitHub page look polished and recruiter-friendly.

✅ Final Checklist (You likely did some of this already)
1. Make sure your README includes:
What the script does (1–3 sentences)

What tools you used (Python, gspread, BeautifulSoup)

A quick “How to run it” section

A screenshot of your Google Sheet (optional but very strong)

A short note like “Feel free to use or adapt this!”

If you want, paste your README here — I can make it more polished.

✅ 2. Now update your LinkedIn post with the GitHub link
At the bottom of your post, add:

GitHub repo: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME

(LinkedIn will hyperlink it automatically.)

If you want, send me your repo URL and I’ll check everything looks clean.

✅ 3. Add one screenshot to your LinkedIn post
Here’s how:

On desktop:
Click the picture icon (🖼️) under your LinkedIn post.

Upload the screenshot of your spreadsheet (not the code — the spreadsheet looks better visually).

LinkedIn will show it as a preview.

Your post will now have:

your personal story

a real screenshot

a GitHub link

This is the ideal LinkedIn combo.

✅ 4. (Optional) Pin the post to your profile
After posting:

Click the “…” on your post.

Select Pin to top of profile.

This makes your project visible to recruiters.

🎯 Want me to refine your README?
If you paste the text here (even if it's rough), I can turn it into a clean, professional README that looks like a real developer wrote it — without changing your voice.

Just send it!

вот этот?
ChatGPT said:
Да, именно этот — job_tracker.py — и нужно загрузить на GitHub.

Вот почему:

это основной скрипт, который делает всю работу;

он достаточно самостоятельный и понятный для людей, которые захотят посмотреть;

это именно тот файл, который ты хочешь “показать миру” как свой мини-проект.

📌 Загружай job_tracker.py, README.md и requirements.txt.
Этого достаточно для аккуратного репозитория.

⚠️ Важно: НЕ загружай credentials.json
Вижу, что в папке есть credentials.json — никогда не загружай этот файл в GitHub, он содержит твой Google API ключ.
Если случайно загрузишь — нужно будет срочно удалить и перевыпустить ключ.

Если хочешь, скинь мне свой README.md (текст) — я сделаю его красивым, читаемым и “как у настоящего инженера”.

You said:
write a read me, so I can add it to the discription 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s a clean, professional, recruiter-friendly README you can paste directly into GitHub.

Job Application Tracker
A Python script that automatically logs all my job applications into a Google Sheet.
It saves time, keeps everything organized, and helps track progress during the job search.

🚀 What This Script Does
Scrapes job posting pages (e.g., LinkedIn) for details

Extracts:

Company

Position

Location

Job link

Salary (if available)

Remote / On-site status

Notes

Automatically writes each application to a connected Google Sheets document

Prevents duplicates and keeps the spreadsheet clean and consistent

This has helped me stay organized while applying to many roles every week.

🛠️ Tech Stack

(Add your screenshot here — highly recommended)

🤝 Contributions
If you want to improve the script or add features (Indeed scraping, error logging, GUI, etc.), feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

🙌 Why I Built This
I used to avoid programming completely — it always felt intimidating.
But during my job search, I realized automation could save hours of repetitive work.
So this project became my first step toward getting comfortable with code.
And it turned out to be a lot more fun than I expected.

If you want, I can also rewrite this in a more casual tone, more technical tone, or add new sections like “Future Features.”

You said:
Improve the How to Use part, explain it in a way, so anyone will be able to understand it 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here’s a much clearer, beginner-friendly, step-by-step “How to Use” section.
Anyone (even someone who has never run a Python script before) will understand it.

📘 How to Use (Beginner-Friendly Guide)
Follow these steps to set up the tracker on your own computer.

1. Download the project
Click the green “Code” button on this page → Download ZIP,
or clone it using:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/job-application-tracker
2. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
You can check this in your terminal:

python3 --version
If you don’t have Python, download it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Install the required packages
Open your terminal inside the project folder and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs all the libraries the script needs (gspread, BeautifulSoup, requests, etc.).

4. Set up Google Sheets access
To allow the script to write to your spreadsheet, you need a Google API key.

Here’s how:

Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/

Create a new project

Enable the Google Sheets API

Create a Service Account

Generate a JSON key and download it → save it as credentials.json

Place it in the same folder as job_tracker.py

⚠️ Do NOT upload this file to GitHub — it contains sensitive keys.

5. Create your Google Sheet
Create a Google Sheet with the columns you want (e.g., DateApplied, Company, Position, etc.).

Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/THIS_IS_THE_ID/edit
Paste this ID into the script where indicated.

6. Run the script
Now you’re ready to use the tracker.

In your terminal:

python3 job_tracker.py
Each time you run the script and provide a job posting URL, the new job will be added to your spreadsheet automatically.

7. Your tracker is ready 🎉
Once everything is set up, the script will:

pull job details from the URL you give it

extract useful information

add the information directly into your Google Sheet

No manual typing required.

If you'd like, I can also add a “Troubleshooting” section or a “Future Improvements” section to make your README look even more polished.

You said:
where should I type it in?
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it — you’re asking where exactly to type or paste the README text in GitHub.
Here’s the simplest guide possible:

✅ WHERE TO PUT YOUR README ON GITHUB
Option 1: If your repo already has a README.md
Go to your GitHub repository

Click the file README.md

Click the small pencil icon ✏️ in the top-right (this means “Edit”)

Delete your old text (or scroll to the bottom)

Paste the new README text I wrote for you

Scroll down and click Commit changes

Done — your GitHub page will automatically update and show the new README.

Option 2: If your repo does NOT have a README.md yet
Do this:

Go to your GitHub repo

Click Add file → Create new file

Name the file exactly:

README.md
In the big text box, paste the README text

Scroll down → click Commit new file

Done — GitHub automatically shows README.md at the bottom of your repo.

📝 Quick Tip
The README should be in the root (main) folder of your repo, NOT inside a subfolder.
This is how GitHub knows to display it on the front page.

If you want
Send me your GitHub repo link and I’ll check:

if everything looks clean

if the README displays correctly

if any files should be moved or renamed

I can also optimize the repo layout for you.

You said:
Generate a **JSON key** and download it → save it as `credentials.json`

explain this step better
ChatGPT said:
Got you — this is the most confusing step, so here is a super clear, beginner-friendly explanation of exactly how to create and save the Google API key (credentials.json).

I’ll break it down into VERY simple steps so you understand what you’re doing and why.

✅ How to Generate a Google API JSON Key (credentials.json)
This file allows your Python script to “log in” to Google Sheets automatically.
You only need to do this once.

STEP 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
Open this link:
👉 https://console.cloud.google.com/

Make sure you're logged into the Google account you want to use.

STEP 2: Create a New Project
In the top-left corner, click the project dropdown

Click New Project

Name it something like Job Tracker

Click Create

STEP 3: Enable the Google Sheets API
With your new project selected, search at the top for:
“Google Sheets API”

Click on it

Click Enable

Now Google gives this project permission to read/write Google Sheets.

STEP 4: Create a Service Account
A service account is like a robot-version of you that the script uses.

On the left menu, go to:
APIs & Services → Credentials

Click Create Credentials → Service Account

Give it any name (e.g., “job-tracker-bot”)

Click Create and Continue

For roles, you can skip (or choose Editor)

Click Done

STEP 5: Create & Download the JSON Key
Now you will create the actual file your script needs.

In Credentials, find your new service account

Click its name

Go to the Keys tab

Click Add Key → Create New Key

Choose JSON

Google will automatically download a file like:

job-tracker-12893712398123.json
This file IS your credentials.json.

STEP 6: Rename & Move the File
Rename it to:

credentials.json
Move it into the same folder as your Python script, for example:

job-application-tracker/
│── job_tracker.py
│── credentials.json   ← place it here
│── requirements.txt
│── README.md
Your script will now be able to connect to Google Sheets.

❗ IMPORTANT WARNING
Do not EVER upload credentials.json to GitHub.
It contains a private key that gives access to your Google account.

GitHub should contain:
✔️ job_tracker.py
✔️ README.md
✔️ requirements.txt

But NOT the JSON key.

STEP 7: Share Your Google Sheet With the Service Account
Your script will NOT work unless your Sheet is shared with the service account.

Open your Google Sheet

Click Share

Copy the email that your service account uses (looks like):

job-tracker-bot@myproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Share the sheet with that email

Give it Editor permissions

Now your script can write into the sheet.

🎉 You're done!
Now your script can authenticate with Google and update your spreadsheet automatically.

If you want, I can create a visual diagram, or rewrite this into ultra-short steps for your README.

Would you like me to add Step 8 (“Share your Google Sheet with the service account”) and Step 9 (“Run the script”)?
These two steps are important for the tracker to work smoothly.

You said:
what are the last two steps for?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — the last two steps are absolutely essential for the script to work.
Without them, the script cannot access your Google Sheet and will throw an error.

Here’s exactly what they do:

✅ Step 8 — Share your Google Sheet with the service account
When you create the service account, Google gives it an email address like:

job-tracker-bot@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Your Python script uses this account (not your personal Gmail) to edit the spreadsheet.

So you must:

Open your Google Sheet

Click Share

Paste the service account email

Give it Editor permissions

🔥 Why this matters
If you skip this step, your script will say something like:

❌ “The caller does not have permission to access the spreadsheet”

The service account needs explicit permission, just like a real person.

✅ Step 9 — Run the script
This is where you actually use the tracker.

You simply run:

python3 job_tracker.py
When you provide a job posting URL, the script will:

✔️ fetch job details
✔️ parse and extract company, position, salary, etc.
✔️ write a new row into your Google Sheet

🔥 Why this matters
This is the moment everything comes together.
If steps 1–8 are setup, step 9 is the execution.

Without running the script, nothing gets added to your spreadsheet.

⚠️ So in short:
Step 8 = Give your bot permission to edit the sheet
Step 9 = Actually use the bot to add job entries
Both are required.
Skipping either one breaks the system.

If you want, I can add both steps to your README in the same clean style we used for the previous ones.

You said:
yeah, write a manual how to do the last two steps 
ChatGPT said:
Here are the last two steps written in the same clear, beginner-friendly style as the rest of your guide.
You can paste this directly under Step 7 in your README.

----------------------------------
8. Share your Google Sheet with the Service Account
Your script uses a “robot account” (the service account) to edit your spreadsheet.
To give it permission, you must share your sheet with its email address.

8.1 Open your Google Sheet
8.2 Click the Share button (top-right)
8.3 Find the email of your service account — it looks like:

job-tracker-bot@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
(You can find this email in Google Cloud Console → IAM → Service Accounts.)

8.4 Paste that email into the Share window
8.5 Give it Editor access
8.6 Click Send

Your script can now safely write into the sheet.

----------------------------------
9. Run the script
Once everything is set up, you can start using your tracker.

9.1 Open your terminal
9.2 Make sure you’re inside the project folder
9.3 Run:

python3 job_tracker.py
9.4 The script will ask you for a job posting URL
Paste the link (e.g., from LinkedIn) and press Enter

Each time you run the script and provide a URL, a new entry will be added automatically to your Google Sheet — including company name, role, salary, location, and more.

If you'd like, I can now merge all steps 1–9 into one clean, final How-To section for your README.

📘 How to Use (Beginner-Friendly Guide)

Follow these steps to set up the tracker on your own computer.

----------------------------------

1. Download the project

1.1 Click the green “Code” button on this page → Download ZIP,
or clone it using:

git clone  https://github.com/fundukk/job-application-tracker

----------------------------------

2. Install Python

2.2 If you don’t have Python, download it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

----------------------------------

3. Install the required packages

3.1 Open your terminal inside the project folder and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs all the libraries the script needs (gspread, BeautifulSoup, requests, etc.).

----------------------------------

4. Set up Google Sheets access

4.1 To allow the script to write to your spreadsheet, you need a Google API key.

Here’s how:
4.2 Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
4.3 Create a new project
4.4 Enable the Google Sheets API

----------------------------------

5. Create a Service Account 
On the left menu, go to:
5.1 APIs & Services → Credentials
5.2 Click Create Credentials → Service Account
5.3 Give it any name (e.g., “job-tracker-bot”)
5.4 Click Create and Continue
5.5 For roles, you can skip (or choose Editor)
5.6 Click Done

----------------------------------

6. Generate a JSON key and download it → save it as credentials.json
Now you will create the actual file your script needs.
6.1 In Credentials, find your new service account
6.2 Click its name
6.3 Go to the Keys tab
6.4 Click Add Key → Create New Key
6.5 Choose JSON
6.6 Google will automatically download a file like:
job-tracker-12893712398123.json

This file IS your credentials.json.
-

----------------------------------

7. Rename & Move the File
7.1 Rename it to:

credentials.json

7.2 Move it into the same folder as your Python script, for example:

job-application-tracker/
│── job_tracker.py
│── credentials.json   ← place it here
│── requirements.txt
│── README.md

Your script will now be able to connect to Google Sheets.

----------------------------------

8. Share your Google Sheet with the Service Account

Your script uses a “robot account” (the service account) to edit your spreadsheet.
To give it permission, you must share your sheet with its email address.

8.1 Open your Google Sheet
8.2 Click the Share button (top-right)
8.3 Find the email of your service account — it looks like:

job-tracker-bot@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
(You can find this email in Google Cloud Console → IAM → Service Accounts.)

8.4 Paste that email into the Share window
8.5 Give it Editor access
8.6 Click Send

Your script can now safely write into the sheet.

----------------------------------

9. Run the script

Once everything is set up, you can start using your tracker.

9.1 Open your terminal
9.2 Make sure you’re inside the project folder
9.3 Run:

python3 job_tracker.py

9.4 The script will ask you for a job posting URL
Paste the link (e.g., from LinkedIn) and press Enter

Each time you run the script and provide a URL, a new entry will be added automatically to your Google Sheet — including company name, role, salary, location, and more.

now, it looks like this. What else should I add?
ChatGPT said:
Your “How to Use” section is already very strong and complete — genuinely better than many GitHub READMEs. But to make the project look polished, professional, and easy for others to adopt, here are 5 important additions you should include.

I’ll list them in order of importance, and if you want, I can write any of them for you.

✅ 1. Add a “Before You Start” section
This gives people a quick overview of what they need before following the steps.

Example:

Before You Start
You will need:

A Google account

A Google Cloud project

A Google Sheet where the data will be stored

Basic Python installed on your machine

This saves beginners from being confused.

✅ 2. Add a “Configuration” section (Spreadsheet ID + Columns)
Your script requires users to paste their Spreadsheet ID inside the code.
Most beginners don’t know where that ID comes from.

Add this:

Find Your Spreadsheet ID
Your Google Sheet URL looks like this:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit#gid=0
Copy the part marked SPREADSHEET_ID and paste it into the script where indicated.

Required Columns
Create a Google Sheet and add the following columns in row 1:

DateApplied | Company | Position | Location | Salary | JobType | Remote | Status | Source | Notes
Otherwise, the script may not run.

✅ 3. Add a “Troubleshooting” section
This will help people who get stuck.
Here are the 3 most common errors:

Troubleshooting
❌ ERROR: “The caller does not have permission”
You didn’t share the Google Sheet with the service account email.
Repeat Step 8.

❌ ERROR: ModuleNotFoundError (gspread, bs4, etc.)
Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
❌ Script runs but nothing appears in the sheet

Wrong Spreadsheet ID

Wrong Google Sheet name or formatting

Sheet not shared with service account

This section makes your project feel polished.

✅ 4. Add a “Screenshots” or “Example Output” section
LinkedIn screenshot or a small cropped version of your sheet.

Example:

Example Output
This is how the tracker looks after running the script:

(insert screenshot)

People love visuals.

✅ 5. Add a “Future Improvements” section
This shows that the project is alive and evolving.

Example:

Future Improvements
Add support for Indeed and Glassdoor

Add duplicate detection

Add command-line arguments

Build a small GUI

Add error logging

Recruiters LOVE seeing future plans — it shows engineering thinking.

🎯 Optional but strong: Add a one-line tagline at the top
Something like:

Automates my job search by logging every application into Google Sheets with one command.

Super clean.

⭐ Recommended final README structure
If you want a polished flow, it should look like:

Project Summary (1–2 lines)

Features

Before You Start

How to Use (Your Section)

Troubleshooting

Example Output (Screenshots)

Future Improvements

License (optional)

If you want, I can now take your entire README, reorganize it, and rewrite it into a beautiful, clean, professional README with sections, emojis, formatting, and consistent style — ready for GitHub.

Just say the word.

You said:
can you update my text so far?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — I’ll keep all your content exactly as you wrote it, but I’ll improve structure, clarity, formatting, and add the missing professional sections (Before You Start, Spreadsheet ID, Troubleshooting, Example Output, Future Improvements).

Here is your updated, polished version — you can paste this directly into your README:

Uploaded image
HOw can I upload a screenshot of mine 
ChatGPT said:
Here are the three correct ways to upload a screenshot into a GitHub README — and I’ll explain the easiest one step-by-step.

✅ The Easiest Method (Drag & Drop directly into README editor)
Go to your README.md on GitHub

Click the pencil icon to edit

Scroll to your “Example Output” section

Drag your screenshot from your desktop directly into the editor

GitHub will automatically upload the image and generate Markdown code like:

![Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
This is the BEST method — nothing else to do.

✔️ No need to manually create <img> tags
✔️ No need to upload files separately
✔️ GitHub hosts the image for you automatically

✅ Method 2: Upload in Issues → Copy link
Go to your repo

Open the “Issues” tab

Create a New Issue (you won’t submit it)

Drag your screenshot into the comment box

GitHub uploads it

Copy the Markdown link it generates

Paste it into your README

Cancel the issue

This method is useful if the README editor acts weird.

✅ Method 3: Upload to assets/ folder in repo
In your repo, click Add file → Upload files

Upload the screenshot

Click the uploaded image

Copy the raw file URL

Insert it in your README like:

![Job Tracker Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../yourfile.png)
🎯 BUT the easiest is still drag & drop directly into the README editor.
Once you drag and drop, you'll see something like:

![Screenshot 2025-12-03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a2a0316-3de8-4f44-8532-eb1e1453f6c2)
And you're done.

If you want, show me the screenshot you want to include — I’ll generate the correct Markdown for you.

You said:
alright and what kind of screen shot should I upload for this section?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — the screenshot you choose will change how professional and impressive your README looks.

Here are the 3 best types of screenshots for your “Example Output” section, ranked from best to acceptable:

🥇 1. Screenshot of your Google Sheet with actual job entries (BEST)
This is the most powerful and visually informative.

Include:
Several rows of applications

Color-coded statuses (Applied / Rejected / Assessment)

Columns visible: Company, Position, Salary, Location, etc.

Clean zoom level (80–100%)

No browser tabs if possible

Why this is the best:
✔️ Shows that the script works
✔️ Immediately communicates value
✔️ Looks professional and real
✔️ Recruiters understand it instantly

People love seeing real output.

🥈 2. Screenshot of the script running in Terminal
This can show:

The command you typed (python3 job_tracker.py)

The URL input prompt

A “Success! Added entry for COMPANY NAME” message (if you have one)

Great as a second screenshot, but not necessary.

🥉 3. Screenshot of your project folder structure
This is more technical and less important.
Only useful if your repo is meant for developers.

🚫 Avoid uploading:
Full desktop screenshots with messy background

Screenshots with personal or private info

Browser full-screen with too many tabs

Partial images that don’t show column names

⭐ Best option for your README right now
Upload a clean screenshot of your Google Sheet that looks like this:

Shows rows 1–20

Includes your column headers

Some green / red / grey cells

No distracting browser UI

Centered and readable

Something like this (example layout):

| DateApplied | Company | Location | Position | Salary | JobType | Remote | Status | Notes |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------|--------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2025-12-03  | PulteGroup | FL | Intern | $20/hr | Internship | On-site | Applied | ...  |
| 2025-12-04  | CIBC | NY | Private Wealth Intern | TBD | Internship | Remote | Assessment | ... |
This is EXACTLY the screenshot that makes people go:
👉 “Oh damn, this is actually useful.”

If you want, upload your candidate screenshot here and I’ll tell you if it's ideal or if you should crop/edit it before posting.

ChatGPT said:
Your README looks excellent — genuinely better than most beginner GitHub projects.
The structure is clear, professional, and beginner-friendly.

Here’s a quick review of what you wrote, plus a few tiny improvements (not mandatory) to make it even cleaner and more consistent.

✅ What you did perfectly
Clear step-by-step structure

Easy for beginners to follow

Accurate instructions

Includes troubleshooting

Includes screenshot

Includes future improvements

Markdown formatting is readable

No overly long explanations

Logical flow

This is already a 9.5/10 README.

🔧 Tiny Improvements (Optional)
Below are very small adjustments you can make — not because your README is wrong, but because these will make it even more polished.

✔️ 1. Fix “-” breaking markdown in Step 6
Right now you have a lone “-” line after:

This file is your credentials.json.
-
---------------------------------------------------
Remove this lone dash (it breaks formatting).

✔️ 2. Add spacing between code blocks and text
Example:

python3 job_tracker.py
Add an empty line after code blocks for better readability.

✔️ 3. Add a note in Step 7 to avoid uploading credentials to GitHub
This is important for beginners:

⚠️ Important: Do NOT upload credentials.json to GitHub — it contains private keys.
✔️ 4. Fix minor markdown indentation
Your numbered lists are great, but some lines have “-“ that look like bullets.
It’s okay, but removing unnecessary hyphens improves readability.

✔️ 5. Add a short summary sentence at the top (optional but professional)
Something like:

This script lets you automatically log job applications into a Google Sheet using Python and the Google Sheets API.

This helps people instantly understand what the project does.

⭐ Improved, polished version with these tiny fixes applied
Here is your README with:

cleaner markdown

unnecessary dashes removed

slight formatting improvements

safety note added

👉 Copy-paste this version if you want the cleanest possible README

🎉 Final Verdict
You did not write anything excessive.
Your README is clean, helpful, and very professional.

If anything, it is exceptionally good for a personal project.

If you'd like, I can help you polish the top description of your repo or help you write a short project tagline.

You said:
Uploaded image
what else should I add?
ChatGPT said:
Your repo already looks shockingly polished for a first public project.
But if you want it to feel complete, credible, and attractive to recruiters, here are the best next upgrades — in order of impact.

None of these are required, but each will make the repo look more “professional developer.”

✅ 1. Add a short project summary at the top of README
Right now the README jumps straight into instructions.

Add 2–3 lines at the very top describing what the script does:

Example:
## 📝 Overview
This Python script automatically logs job applications into a Google Sheet.
It extracts information from LinkedIn job postings (company, role, salary, etc.)
and adds them as rows in your spreadsheet with one command.
This gives context before the long guide begins.

✅ 2. Add a “Features” section (short bullet list)
This makes it easy for visitors to understand the benefits.

Example:
## ✨ Features
- Scrapes job posting details from LinkedIn
- Automatically writes data to Google Sheets
- Prevents duplicates
- Supports manual notes and status tracking
- Saves time during high-volume job applications
This is a high-impact addition with almost no work.

✅ 3. Add a license (MIT License)
It makes the project look more official and avoids issues if others want to reuse code.

Just add a file called:

LICENSE
And paste the MIT License content (I can create it for you).

MIT license is standard for simple projects.

✅ 4. Add a “Repository Structure” section
Helps people understand what each file is:

## 📁 Repository Structure
job-application-tracker/
│── job_tracker.py       # Main script
│── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
│── README.md            # Documentation
Simple, clean, professional.

✅ 5. Add badges (optional but looks pro)
Badges make your project look like a real GitHub package.

Examples:

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success.svg)
They show:

language

project status

license

Looks amazing at the top of a README.

✅ 6. Add a “How It Works” diagram (optional)
Very simple, just 3 steps:

Job URL → Python Script → Google Sheet row
Can be a small ASCII diagram or a quick image.

This helps non-technical people.

✅ 7. Add a “Contributing” section (even if simple)
Just to encourage improvements:

## 🤝 Contributing
Pull requests and suggestions are welcome!
Feel free to open an issue if you'd like to propose a feature.
Makes your repo feel open and alive.

⭐ MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS TO ADD NOW (minimum upgrade)
If you want the fastest improvement with greatest effect, add:

Saves time during your job search

📁 Repository Structure
job-application-tracker/
│── job_tracker.py       # Main script that scrapes jobs and updates Google Sheet
│── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
│── README.md            # Documentation
📘 How to Use (Beginner-Friendly Guide)
Follow these steps to set up the tracker on your own computer.

Before You Start
You will need:

A Google account

A Google Cloud project (created during setup)

A Google Sheet where your applications will be stored

Python 3 installed on your computer

1. Download the Project
Click the green “Code” button → Download ZIP,
or clone the repository using:

git clone https://github.com/fundukk/job-application-tracker
2. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Check by running:

python3 --version
If you don’t have Python, download it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Install the Required Packages
Inside the project folder, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs all necessary libraries (gspread, BeautifulSoup, requests, etc.).

4. Set Up Google Sheets Access
To allow the script to write to your spreadsheet, you need a Google API key.

Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/

Create a new project

Enable the Google Sheets API

5. Create a Service Account
In Google Cloud Console:

Go to APIs & Services → Credentials

Click Create Credentials → Service Account

Name it (e.g., job-tracker-bot)

Click Create and Continue

Skip roles (or select Editor)

Click Done

6. Generate a JSON Key and Download It
In Credentials, select your new service account

Open the Keys tab

Click Add Key → Create New Key

Choose JSON

A file like this will download:

job-tracker-123456.json
This file is your authentication key (credentials.json).

7. Rename & Move the File
Rename the file to:

credentials.json
Move it to the same folder as your Python script:

job-application-tracker/
│── job_tracker.py
│── credentials.json
│── requirements.txt
│── README.md
⚠️ Do NOT upload credentials.json to GitHub — it contains private keys.

8. Share Your Google Sheet With the Service Account
Your script cannot update the spreadsheet until you give permission.

Open your Google Sheet

Click Share

Paste your service account email (looks like):

job-tracker-bot@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
You can find this email under IAM → Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console.

Set permission to Editor

Click Send

9. Run the Script
Inside the project folder, run:

python3 job_tracker.py
The script will prompt you for a job URL.
Paste a LinkedIn job link and press Enter.

A new row will automatically be added to your Google Sheet — including:

Company

Role

Salary

Location

Job type

Notes

Status

🔑 Finding Your Spreadsheet ID
Your Google Sheet URL looks like this:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit#gid=0
Copy the part labeled SPREADSHEET_ID and paste it into the script where indicated.

📊 Example Output
Here is how the tracker looks after running the script:

<img width="1160" height="355" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 17 47 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b85bda9d-6ac8-4538-a86d-ba907144267f" />
🛠️ Troubleshooting
❌ ERROR: “The caller does not have permission”
→ You forgot to share the Google Sheet with your service account. Repeat Step 8.

❌ ModuleNotFoundError (gspread, bs4, etc.)
→ Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt
❌ Script runs but no data appears in the sheet
→ Check:

Spreadsheet ID is correct

Sheet is shared with the service account

Filename is exactly credentials.json

🚀 Future Improvements
Add Indeed / Glassdoor scraping

Improve salary extraction

Add duplicate detection

Create a GUI

Add logging and error handling

how to do a license
ChatGPT said:
Creating a license on GitHub is super easy — it takes less than 20 seconds.
Here’s exactly how to do it:

✅ How to Add a License to Your GitHub Repository (MIT License)
Option A — The easiest method (GitHub auto-generates it)
Go to your repository on GitHub

Click “Add file” → “Create new file”

Name the file exactly:

LICENSE
On the right side of the page, you will see a button:

➡️ “Choose a license template”

Click it

Select MIT License

GitHub will autofill everything for you, including:

Full license text

Your name

The current year

Scroll down → click Commit new file

Done. 🎉
Your repo now officially has the MIT license.

Option B — Manually add a MIT License (copy/paste)
If for some reason the template button doesn’t appear, do this:

Create a new file called:

LICENSE
Paste this text:

MIT License

Click Commit new file

Done.

❓ Which license should you choose?
For your project, MIT License is perfect because it:

Allows others to use, copy, modify, even sell your code

Requires only credit to you

Is the most common license for small Python projects

Avoids legal complications

Almost all open-source GitHub projects use MIT for scripts like yours.

If you want, I can also:

✅ Add a license badge to your README
✅ Write a short explanation: “This project is licensed under MIT License”
✅ Help choose another license if you want something more restrictive

Just tell me!

You said:
why do I need a license? If I go to umich, maybe Umich license?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — and VERY smart to ask before adding a license.
Here’s the clear explanation in simple language:

✅ Why do you need a license at all?
When you put code on GitHub with no license, the legal default is:

❌ Nobody is allowed to use, copy, modify, or share your code.
Even if people want to use your project, they legally cannot, unless you explicitly give permission.

A license gives others legal permission on your terms.

🧠 Do you need a University of Michigan license?
No. Absolutely not.

Here’s why:

1. This is your personal project, not UMich-owned work.
You wrote it on your own, outside research labs, not funded by UMich, not using UMich’s intellectual property.

So UMich has zero ownership over this code.

UMich licenses (like BSD 3-Clause) apply to software developed as official university research, not student personal scripts.

2. Adding a UMich license implies UMich “authored” or “endorses” your software
This is not true, so you cannot use a UMich institutional license.

3. Recruiters expect MIT License for personal projects
MIT License is clean, simple, and recognizable.

🟢 The correct license for you: MIT License
MIT License is:

Common

Safe

Very permissive

Perfect for portfolio projects

What nearly every student developer uses

It also protects YOU legally:

If someone uses your code and something breaks → you’re not responsible

If someone sells your code → they must credit you

If someone copies your repo → it’s allowed, but with your name in the license

📌 Summary
You need a license because:
Without it, people cannot legally use your code

MIT License protects you and encourages others to learn from your work

You should NOT use a UMich license because:
UMich did not create this code

You are the sole owner

It would imply UMich responsibility or endorsement

Therefore:
👉 Use MIT License. It is the right choice.

If you want, I can:

Add a badge to your README (“License: MIT”)

Help you finalize the LICENSE file

Add a short line in your README: “Licensed under MIT License”

Just say the word.

You said:
Uploaded image
ChatGPT said:
This screen is exactly what you want, and everything on it is correct.

Here’s what to do now:

✅ 1. Keep MIT License selected
You already have it highlighted — perfect choice.

MIT is:

simple

widely used

ideal for personal/student projects

safe for portfolio work

✅ 2. “Year” = 2025
Correct — leave it as 2025.

This marks the year the project was published.
It doesn’t need to match when you wrote it — just when you open-sourced it.

✅ 3. “Full name” = Fedor Zybin
Correct.

GitHub will print:

Copyright (c) 2025 Fedor Zybin
Which is exactly what you want.

✅ 4. Click “Review and submit”
This will:

Add the LICENSE file automatically

Commit it to your main branch

Make GitHub show “MIT License” in the sidebar

Make your repo officially open-source

You’re done. 🎉

🔍 What the MIT License allows (in simple words)
✔️ Anyone can:
Use your code

Copy it

Modify it

Share it

Even sell it

❗ But only if they:
Keep your name in the license file

✔️ You keep your copyright
Your name stays permanently attached to the project.

✔️ You are protected from legal claims
If someone uses your code and breaks something → not your problem.

🎯 Final: This is the perfect license for your project
Your setup is correct.
Click “Review and submit” → commit → done.

If you want, I can now help you:

Add a license badge to your README

Suggest a GitHub project description

Write the top tagline for your repo (“Python script that logs job applications…”)

Just tell me.

You said:
Uploaded image
all good?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — everything is perfect.

This is exactly what a correct MIT License file should look like, and yours contains:

✔️ Correct license name
✔️ Correct year (2025)
✔️ Your full name
✔️ Standard MIT text (unchanged, which is important)
✔️ No formatting issues
✔️ Proper placement in the root of the repo

The next step is simply:

👉 Click “Commit changes…”
👉 Commit directly to main

Once you do that:

Your repo will officially display “MIT License” in the right sidebar

GitHub will index the license for search

Your project becomes properly open-source

Recruiters/devs will see you know how to handle licensing

Everything looks 100% correct.
You’re good to go. 🎉

If you want, we can now:

📌 Add license + Python badges at the top of README
📌 Polish the repo description/tagline
📌 Improve SEO keywords so people find it more easily on GitHub

Just tell me.

nah nah like, how to copy a code and insert it in python 
ChatGPT said:
Ahhh GOT IT — you want a super simple beginner explanation for a random person who doesn't know GitHub or Python yet:

👉 How do I copy this code from GitHub and run it in Python on my computer?

Perfect, here is the cleanest possible version — short, friendly, and understandable even for someone who never coded before.

🐍 How to Copy This Code and Run It in Python (For Complete Beginners)
If you just want to take this script and run it on your computer, here’s exactly what to do:

1️⃣ Install Python
If you don’t already have Python:

Download it here → https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install it like any other program.

To check it works, open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type:

python3 --version
A version number means it worked.

2️⃣ Copy the Code Into a File
On GitHub:

Open job_tracker.py

Click the Raw button (top right)

Select all the code (Cmd + A / Ctrl + A)

Copy it (Cmd + C / Ctrl + C)

Open a text editor:

Mac: TextEdit (set to plain text)

Windows: Notepad

Or use VS Code if installed

Paste the code

Save the file as:

job_tracker.py
Make sure the file extension is .py, not .txt.

3️⃣ Install the Required Libraries
Open your terminal in the same folder where you saved the file.

Run:

pip install gspread requests beautifulsoup4 google-auth
(This installs everything the script uses.)

4️⃣ Run the Script
In Terminal or Command Prompt, type:

python3 job_tracker.py
Press Enter.

5️⃣ Follow the Prompts
The script will ask you to enter a job link.
Paste a LinkedIn job URL, press Enter, and the program will begin working.

That’s it!
You just copied the code, saved it, installed Python, and ran a real Python script.

⭐ If you want this even shorter (for beginners in README):
👉 How to Copy and Run This Code
Install Python

Open the file job_tracker.py on GitHub

Click Raw → Copy All

Paste into a text editor and save as job_tracker.py

Open terminal and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 job_tracker.py
If you want, I can add this as a new section in your README called:

“Running the Script If You’re New to Python”

Just say yes.

You said:
Uploaded image
is this enough to download all packages?
ChatGPT said:
Almost — but only if your requirements.txt actually lists all dependencies.

For the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
to work correctly, your requirements.txt file must include every library your script uses, like:

gspread
google-auth
google-auth-oauthlib
google-auth-httplib2
requests
beautifulsoup4
If your file already contains these, then YES — the user only needs to run one command and everything installs.

✅ So the real question is:
👉 Does your requirements.txt include all the actual packages required by the script?

If your script uses:

gspread

google.oauth2.service_account

requests

BeautifulSoup (from bs4)

maybe re, sys, datetime (built-in — do NOT include)

Then your requirements file should be:

gspread
google-auth
requests
beautifulsoup4
🔍 Want me to check your requirements.txt?
Just paste the contents here — I’ll audit it in 5 seconds and confirm whether:

it's complete

you're missing anything

you have unnecessary things

⭐ QUICK ANSWER:
✔️ If your requirements.txt is correct → that command installs everything.
❌ If your requirements.txt is incomplete → some libraries will be missing and the script will error.
Send me your file and I’ll fix it instantly.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
❌ ERROR: “The caller does not have permission”
→ You forgot to share the Google Sheet with your service account email. Repeat Step 8.

❌ ModuleNotFoundError (gspread, bs4, etc.)
→ Install dependencies again:

pip install -r requirements.txt
❌ Script runs but no data appears in the sheet
→ Check:

Wrong Spreadsheet ID

Wrong Sheet permissions

Wrong file name for credentials (credentials.json must match exactly)
