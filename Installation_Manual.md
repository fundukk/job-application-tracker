# 📝 Job Application Tracker

A Python tool that automatically logs job applications into a Google Sheet.  
It extracts details from LinkedIn job postings — company, role, salary, job type, and more — and saves them in a clean, structured spreadsheet.  
This project helps streamline high-volume job applications and keeps your search organized.


## How to Use (Beginner-Friendly Guide)

Follow these steps to set up the tracker on your own computer.

### Before You Start

You will need:

- A Google account  
- A Google Cloud project (created during setup)  
- A Google Sheet where your applications will be stored  
- Python 3 installed on your computer  



### 1. Download the Project

Click the green **“Code”** button on the main page → **Download ZIP**,  
or clone it using:

git clone https://github.com/fundukk/job-application-tracker

<img width="781" height="163" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 17 25 58" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41eb1b79-f8d5-4de9-87b4-69ddd3b53e43" />

You may delete all the manuals, and keep **job_tracker.py** and **requirements** only.x

### 2. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check this in your terminal:

python3 --version

- If you don’t have Python, download it from:

https://www.python.org/downloads/


### 3. Install the Required Packages
Open your terminal inside the project folder and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

-- This installs all the libraries listed in requirements.txt that the script needs
(for example: gspread, google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-auth-httplib2, requests, beautifulsoup4, etc.).

#### !!If this fails for some reason, you can install them manually!!:

pip install gspread google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 requests beautifulsoup4

- gspread — to write into Google Sheets  
- google-auth — authentication  
- google-auth-oauthlib — OAuth + service account helpers  
- google-auth-httplib2 — HTTP transport for Google APIs  
- requests — download job pages  
- beautifulsoup4 — HTML parsing

## 🛠 If you get “pip: command not found”

Some systems (especially macOS) do not have a standalone pip command.
If `pip install ...` gives you an error, run this instead:

- python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

<b> This uses pip inside Python and works on all platforms. </b> 

If pip is still missing, install it with:

- python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
- python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

### 4. Set Up Google Sheets Access
To allow the script to write to your spreadsheet, you need a Google API key.

- Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/

- Create a new project

<img width="1113" height="786" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 17 31 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac58d4a6-eb57-4ec5-922c-e42b713f4c1d" />


- Enable the Google Sheets API for that project

### 5. Create a Service Account
In Google Cloud Console, on the left menu:

- Go to APIs & Services → Credentials

- Click Create Credentials → Service Account

<img width="1512" height="982" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 17 36 28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f93b30-8031-4494-b054-2afecf9abe79" />

- Give it any name (e.g., job-tracker-bot)

- Click Create and Continue

- You may skip roles (or choose Editor)

Click Done



### 6. Generate a JSON Key and Download It
This file allows the script to authenticate.

- In Credentials, find your new service account

- Click its name

- Go to the Keys tab

- Click Add Key → Create New Key

- Choose JSON

 <img width="1465" height="550" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-04 at 17 42 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c729e6d0-bbb4-4f61-be91-8f5cf95326d3" />

- A file like this will download:

job-tracker-12893712398123.json

### This file is your credentials.json.

---------------------- 

### 7. Rename & Move the File

Rename the downloaded file to: credentials.json

- Move it into the same folder as your Python script, for example:

job-application-tracker/

│── job_tracker.py

│── credentials.json   ← place it here

│── requirements.txt

│── README.md

- Your script will now be able to connect to Google Sheets.

<img width="248" height="107" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 19 22 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/011ae1bb-4434-4147-94b2-a88739e032d0" />

⚠️ Important: Do NOT upload credentials.json to GitHub — it contains private keys.

### 8. Share Your Google Sheet With the Service Account

Your script uses a “robot account” (the service account) to edit your spreadsheet.
To give it permission, you must share your sheet with its email address.

- Open your Google Sheet

- Click the Share button (top-right)

- Find the email of your service account — it looks like:

job-tracker-bot@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
(You can find this email in Google Cloud Console → IAM → Service Accounts.)

- Paste that email into the Share window

- Give it Editor access

Click Send

### Your script can now safely write into the sheet.


### 9. Run the Script
Once everything is set up, you can start using your tracker.

- Open your terminal

- Make sure you’re inside the project folder

Run:

python3 job_tracker.py

- The script will ask you for a job posting URL
Paste the link (e.g., from LinkedIn) and press Enter

## Each time you run the script and provide a URL, a new entry will be added automatically to your Google Sheet — including company name, role, salary, location, and more.

### 🔑 Finding Your Spreadsheet ID
Your Google Sheet URL looks like this:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit#gid=0

- Copy the part labeled SPREADSHEET_ID and paste it into the script where indicated.

### 📊 Example Output
Here is how the tracker looks after running the script:

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting
❌ ERROR: “The caller does not have permission”
→ You forgot to share the Google Sheet with your service account email. Repeat Step 8.

❌ ModuleNotFoundError (gspread, bs4, etc.)
→ Install dependencies again:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

❌ Script runs but no data appears in the sheet
→ Check:
- Wrong Spreadsheet ID
- Wrong Sheet permissions
- Wrong file name for credentials (credentials.json must match exactly)


### Future Improvements
Add support for Indeed or Glassdoor URLs

- Improve salary scraping
- Add duplicate detection
- Add a GUI for non-technical users
- Add error logging
- Make the code more universal
