## 🧑‍💻 Using the Job Tracker

Once you’ve set everything up, you can run the script, by typing this in your terminal:

- python3 job_tracker.py

This starts an interactive command shell, where you can type commands like addjob or replace.

## 🔹 Available Commands

In the interactive shell (python3 job_tracker.py):

- addjob, add, a → Add a new job application.

- replace, r, redo → Move the most recent entry to a Trash sheet and then add a new job (with special “replace by link” behavior, see below).

- help, h, ? → Show the list of commands.

- exit, quit, q → Leave the program.

From the command line:

- python3 job_tracker.py addjob → Immediately starts the “add job” flow in a loop (after each job, it asks if you want to add another).

- python3 job_tracker.py replace → Moves the most recent entry to Trash and then starts the “add job (replace mode)” flow.

- python3 job_tracker.py loop / run / interactive → Same as running addjob in a loop.

## ➕ Adding a Job (addjob)

### 1. When you run addjob (via shell or directly), the script:

<img width="827" height="130" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 20 02 35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d8d5e0-3dde-4154-adae-b6f7c64772c7" />

- Paste a LinkedIn or company job URL.

- If you leave this empty, the script cancels.

 ### 2. Tries to auto-fill fields

If it’s a LinkedIn URL, the script scrapes:

- Position

- Company

- Location

- Salary (if visible)

- Job type (Internship / Full-time, etc.)
 
- Remote hint (Remote / Hybrid / On-site)

- For non-LinkedIn URLs, it makes a best guess for position / company / location.

It then shows you what it found, e.g.:

<img width="824" height="222" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 20 05 03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e6e955-d495-4cb0-bc6d-4474bb816ad8" />


### 3. Walks you through each field with defaults

For each field, it shows a prompt. If there is scraped data, it’s shown in brackets as a default. 

Press Enter to accept the value in brackets.

Type your own value to override.

You can type < or back to go one step back to the previous field.

Special behavior for Salary:

- You can type things like $25/hr, $20–25/hr, $70k, $80k–$100k, $4000/mo, etc.

The script automatically converts:

- hourly ↔ yearly

- monthly ↔ yearly + hourly

## If you type words like negotiable, tbd, n/a, market, etc., they are saved as-is. If there’s no real salary info on the page, the script saves Undetermined and shades that cell gray in the sheet.

### 4. Remote & Job Type

The script guesses Remote/Hybrid/On-site from the page and your location, but you can change it.

- Same for Job Type (Full-time, Part-time, Internship, etc.).

  ### 5. Notes

- Free text field.

- Use it for reminders like EASY APPLY, Applied via company portal, etc.

  ### 6. Confirmation step

Before saving, it shows a full summary:

<img width="822" height="522" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 20 07 19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd5ed9d4-2ad6-4944-8b6c-a3c9544a67b5" />

- y / yes → saves the row

- n / anything else → cancels

- < / back → lets you go back and edit fields (mainly Notes / Job type / Remote)

  ### 7. Duplicate protection

Before saving, the script checks if the same Link already exists in the sheet.

- If it finds a match, it prints a warning (эта ссылка уже сохранена) and does not save a duplicate row.

  ## 🔁 Replace Mode (replace / addjob with use_replace_mode=True)

There are two related features:

- Command: replace (shell or CLI) This is meant for “oops, I mis-logged the last job” situations.

It moves the most recent entry (the first data row under the header) to a separate Trash sheet.

Then it starts the normal “add job” wizard, but in replace mode.

## What “replace mode” does differently? | When use_replace_mode=True (i.e., when triggered via replace)

If the new job’s link already exists somewhere in the sheet:

- The old row with that link is moved to Trash (or deleted if Trash move fails).

- The new row is inserted back at the same row index.

If the link is completely new:

- It’s inserted as a new row at position 2 (just like normal addjob).

** In both cases, it again applies salary coloring: ** 

- Gray background for Undetermined or manual keywords

- White for numeric salaries

** So: **

- addjob → never overwrites, just adds new rows (and skips exact duplicate links).

- replace → explicitly lets you undo the last entry and/or replace an existing link.

# 🗑️ Trash Sheet

When you delete or replace entries, they’re not just lost.

- The script keeps a separate sheet named Trash in the same Google Spreadsheet.

- Every time a row is “deleted” or replaced, its old contents are copied into Trash (newest at the top).

** This is useful if you accidentally removed the wrong job and want to restore it manually. **

### 📥 What Gets Saved in the Sheet

- Each row contains:

- DateApplied — today’s date

- Company

- Location

- Position

- Link

- Salary (with conversions where possible)

- JobType

- Remote (On-site / Hybrid / Remote)

- Status — always "Applied" by default

- Source — inferred from the link (LinkedIn / Indeed / Glassdoor / Company / Other)

- Notes — whatever you typed

** This makes it easy to filter, sort, and analyze your job search directly in Google Sheets. **
